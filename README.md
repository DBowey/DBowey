- 👋 Hi, I’m @DBowey
- 👀 I’m interested in scalable, well-designed solutions that accomplish business goals.  Code solves problems, and languages are tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to best integrate solutions into public cloud platforms, like Azure, and experimenting with more modern design idioms for software solutions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects where my experience as an integrator, creating solutions in the right tool for the job, could be valuable.  I like the whole 
          process, from solution design to test-and-iterate to post-go-live support.
- 📫 How to reach me?  Email me at dbowey@pival.com
